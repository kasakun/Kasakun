# kasakun

Personal website of myself. We will have blogs, bookstore, demo, photo, etc.

For the blog part, articles on this site is different with blog.czy-kasakun.com
which are diary or words besides coding rather than pure technical review. Yes,
this site is designed for life and experience.

Currently I am not going to merge these two sites. This sounds wired but I will
try to find a better way to fix it.

## About static resource

All the static resource is stored at http://static.czy-kasakun.com/kasakun
The reason is that I feel really painful to apply Django's static setting.
Now all the resources are collected and deployed at the cloud.
